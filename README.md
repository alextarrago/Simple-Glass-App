Basic Google Glass App
===============

Basic Google Glass app with voice trigger for launching the application and options menu when tapping.

##Features

 * Voice trigger for launching (in this case "Start a basic app"). Easy configuration for using your own voice trigger.
 * Basic text showing "Great, your first app!"
 * Options menu when tapping using GestureDetector. In this case just two options but easy to increase the number of items. See src/menu/main.xml
  

All documented for learning and testing. This is a perfect project to start your own! :)

Have fun!
